# calculator-app-ios
This is a simple calculator app for iOS, created for a mobile development class.
It can do basic arithmetic, and it displays the operation history as you use it.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
The app requires Swift 3, which comes bundled with Xcode 8.3.3.
If you're using a newer version of Xcode, there may be compatibility issues with
Swift 4 syntax, so make sure your version comes with the right version of Swift.

### Installing
When you first open Xcode, select the option to `Check out an existing project`.
In the field where it asks for your repository location, enter
`https://github.com/vennturtle/calculator-app-ios.git`, select the branch you want
to work with, and save it to a location on your system.
